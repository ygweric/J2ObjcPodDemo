# J2ObjcPodDemo
J2Objc swift demo with cocoapods


### This project can't be compiled

I'm tring to use j2objc with cocoapods and swift, now I can compile j2objc framework, but when I compile my swift project with j2objc framework, there will be errors `Include of non-modular header inside framework module 'j2objc_j2objc_debug.ModelId'`

Can anybody help me ?

I've tried the following way to fix it, but totally failed

### How to use this demo

 1. Run `pod install`
 2. build `j2objc_j2objc_debug`, maybe you need to configure the `Header Search Paths` and `Library Search Paths` to your `$j2objc_home`
 3. build `J2ObjcPodDemo`, maybe you need to configure the `Header Search Paths` to your `$j2objc_home`

Then this will be error : `Include of non-modular header inside framework module 'j2objc_j2objc_debug.ModelId'`
 
### Directory structure
 * in `j2objcOutputs`, it is my objc code which is generated by `j2objc-grandle`
 * The `Podfile` is configured by `j2objc-grandle`
 
### Some other things
 * I can compile my project if I add all objc source files into my project directly, without error, But it is better to use pods
 * I've try to configure differnt path, etc., no work
